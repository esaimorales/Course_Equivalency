COEN Graduate Student Course Equivalency System

Description:

New COEN graduate students from schools other than
SCU often claim they have taken the equivalent of
SCU courses, which may or may not be true.
Individual faculty advisors try to make a
determination of equivalency. This system
would identify courses for which equivalency
had already been determined.
